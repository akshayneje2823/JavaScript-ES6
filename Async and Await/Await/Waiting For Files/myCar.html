        Keanu Reeves, a gearhead himself, has played many roles in his career in various films. However, the John Wick series is critically acclaimed to be one of his best performances. Reeves portrayed the lead role as a trained assassin, out to avenge the murder of his beloved dog â€” Daisy, a beagle puppy who came into his life after the death of his wife Helen. The original film is also one of the best action films in 2014 when it was released.
